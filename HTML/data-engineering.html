                <br><br>
                We design the platform from both the hardware and software viewpoints, considering the performance the

                This may work well for operational tasks, but to develop analytics tools and AI models to generate
                insight from these data, it’s often necessary to integrate said data to a common platform where
                analytical and operational workloads can be kept separate and the data from various sources used

                    This is done using multilingual speech recognition to translate speech to words, transformer based
                    NLP models to understand the content of a customer’s sentence and non-autoregressive Transformer

                        People should come to us when they have a business problem where they intuitively feel that the
                        solution could be hidden in data and that it can not be solved by writing a couple of simple
                        rules. If this is the case, AI might be the solution.<br><br>

                        To actually define an AI use case, business leaders will need the help of an AI team, who judge
                        if and how to proceed with the problem enhancement; the problem owner who knows the most about
                        the issue; and technical specialists who understand how the problem described by the problem
                        owner can be interacted with in the technical world.
