                AI-based natural language understanding (NLU) solutions allow machines to perform these tasks at a speed
                that is unmatched by humans. This allows us to classify entire documents, divide them into sections by

                food’s quality.
                <br>
                <br>
                Machines are generally not very good at reading emotions, but with the aid of AI, they can pick up cues
                that indicate the sentiment attached to a segment of text, showing whether the content is happy, sad, or
                evokes any other sentiment the model is trained to recognize.

                social media. In this case, NLU and sentiment analysis are used in tandem to recognize topics of

            Speaker recognition is one area where machines very often outperform humans, not only in recognition accuracy but also in the number of people these systems can accurately identify. As with humans, this is, of course, strongly affected by the quality of the sound. For example, speaker recognition in a phone call is inherently less accurate than in a recording of a meeting. </p>

            <p class="text-dark mt-5">
                Emotions can be determined from audio in a similar fashion to sentiment analysis in text. This is even more important here since speech recognition itself is imperfect, and people focus less on the tone of words when voice can be used.<br><br>

            This is particularly important when speaking with customers over the phone since it helps to understand how strongly they feel about the reason for the call, or when contacting emergency services because the emotion in the caller’s voice can indicate the urgency of the call. </p>

                    This is done using multilingual speech recognition to translate speech to words, transformer based
                    NLP models to understand the content of a customer’s sentence and non-autoregressive Transformer
                    based text to speech models that provide Annika with her signature voice.</p>

                        People should come to us when they have a business problem where they intuitively feel that the

                        rules. If this is the case, AI might be the solution.<br><br>

                        To actually define an AI use case, business leaders will need the help of an AI team, who judge
                        if and how to proceed with the problem enhancement; the problem owner who knows the most about
                        the issue; and technical specialists who understand how the problem described by the problem
                        owner can be interacted with in the technical world.
